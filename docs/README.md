# Corinda Docs

Corinda is a concurrency and entropy based hash cracker. It takes advantage of the concurrency possibilities of Go Language to learn new password model entropy patterns, as well as to make guesses against a target hash.

## Golang Primitives

## Elementary Models

Corinda abstracts password substrings as Models. For example, in the password `corinda123`, the substring `corinda` belongs to the Model of words belonging to a dictionary, and `123` belongs to the Model of three number sequences.
