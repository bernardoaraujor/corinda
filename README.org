#+TITLE: corinda

Corinda is a Bayesian hash cracker and password strength estimator.

Theoretical foundation relies on Set Theory, and BStatistical Inference. Corinda expands upon the notions already established in Sahin et al. [1]. Previous results by Rodrigues et al. [2] suggest that human-biased models generate passwords with distinct statistical patterns, raising the following questions:

 - Can a Password's Strength be modeled as a Statistical Inference problem? 
 - Can the process of Password Cracking be fully optmized by Machine Learning?
